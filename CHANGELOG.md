- Do not initialize variables if not needed.
- Do not check for `NULL` when not needed.
- Move Xiaomi Davinci struct to private header.
- Add symbol list to avoid exposing more symbols.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- Gyroscope sensor support.
- Vala bindings generation.
- GObject introspection generation.

### Fixed
- Thread symbol leaking into global scope.

### Changed
- Drop reporting threads as these are not necessary.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-02-21

### Fixed
- Load libqrtr on Debian correctly for mocking SSC.
- Use `g_assert_no_error` in tests.
- Let meson look for Python instead of specifying the binary name when mocking.
- Add `g_cond` for report threads to avoid race conditions.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-12

### Fixed

- Use proper GErrors instead of g\_warning for errors.

### Fixed
- Passing GTask in libssc-sensor was missing.

### Fixed
- Fixed LICENSE to properly indicate GPLv3.
- Add architecture diagram referenced in reverse engineering notes.
- Fix .so library name to avoid twice 'lib': liblibssc.so

### Added
- Timeout parameter for ssccli.
- Flush stdout after each sensor measurement in ssccli.
- Add support for proximity sensor of xiaomi-davinci (SM7150).

### Changed
- Expanded README with proper description and link to landing page.
- Added build instructions to README.
- Added custom domain for landing page in README.

## [0.1.4] - 2023-08-19

- Assert QMI client not NULL during sensor disposing.

### Added
- Define unknown type in QMI Report messages as Report Type.

### Changed
