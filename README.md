# libssc

`libssc` is a library to <b>expose the sensors</b> managed by the <b>Qualcomm Sensor Core</b>
found in many Qualcomm System-on-Chips (SoCs) from 2018 and onwards. 

Qualcomm SoCs feature a Sensor Lower Power Island (SLPI)
to offload sensors to a dedicated <b>Digital Signal Processor (DSP)</b>
for <b>optimizing power consumption</b> and <b>reducing the tasks of the main CPU</b>.
This way, the main CPU may enter full suspend while the DSP can detect proximity
from the proximity sensor and wake up the main CPU.
<b>Direct access to the sensors is prohibited</b> by the hypervisor,
thus the only way to access sensors on these SoCs is by talking
to the DSP managing these sensors.
Libssc performs this task and <b>exposes the sensors as a GLib-based library</b>
which allows seamless integration with the existing Linux ecosystem.

## Documentation

General information about libssc, documentation, and other information can be found at
[https://libssc.dylanvanassche.be](https://libssc.dylanvanassche.be).

## Building

`libssc` uses the Meson build system with a minimal list of external dependencies:

- `libqmi >=1.33.4`
- `glib >= 2.56`
- `protobuf-c`

`libssc` tests requires an additional dependency to compile the ProtoBuf messages for simulating the DSP QMI responses:

- `protobuf`
- `python-gobject3`
- `qrtr-libs`

```
meson setup _build
meson compile -C _build
```

Tests can be executed with:

```
meson test -C _build
```

## Linking against libssc

Use `pkg-config` in your favorite build system to link against `libssc`.
The library is called `libssc`, in Meson it looks like this:

```
libssc_dep = dependency('libssc')
```

## Lockdown

Systemd features a lockdown feature to reduce access to resources for services.
If `libssc` is used in a service such as `iio-sensor-proxy`, make sure access to the address family `AF_QIPCRTR`
otherwise access to the QRTR bus is prohibited.

## Tests

Libssc has tests with and without the SSC mocking server to verify also the behavior
of libssc when the QMI service is not present.
